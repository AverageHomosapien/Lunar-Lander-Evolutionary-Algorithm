# CI-Coursework
This was a 3rd year coursework done as part of the Computational Intelligence module.

## Overview
The task was to try to safely land spaceships in a game environment, using an Evolutionary Algorithm.
A neural network was used by the spaceships to understand when, and when not to fire their thrusters.
We were given the task of creating an evolutionary algorithm which evolved the weights of the neural network 
to allow spaceships to land safely.

I used a unique approach, using mutation as an exploration and exploitation operator and was able to achieve solid results for the task.

I give an example screenshot of the game environment below:
